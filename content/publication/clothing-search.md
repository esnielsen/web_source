abstract = "Growing threats to biodiversity and global alteration of habitats and species distributions makeit increasingly necessary to consider evolutionary patterns in conservation decision making. Yet, there is noclear-cut guidance on how genetic features can be incorporated into conservation-planning processes, despitemultiple molecular markers and several genetic metrics for each marker type to choose from. Genetic patternsdiffer between species, but the potential tradeoffs among genetic objectives for multiple species in conservationplanning are currently understudied. We compared spatial conservation prioritizations derived from 2 metricsof genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) and 2 metrics of genetic isolation (private haplotypesand local genetic differentiation) in mitochondrial DNA of 5 marine species. We compared outcomes ofconservation plans based only on habitat representation with plans based on genetic data and habitatrepresentation. Fewer priority areas were selected for conservation plans based solely on habitat representationthan on plans that included habitat and genetic data. All 4 genetic metrics selected approximately similarconservation-priority areas, which is likely a result of prioritizing genetic patterns across a genetically diversearray of species. Largely, our results suggest that multispecies genetic conservation objectives are vital tocreating protected-area networks that appropriately preserve community-level evolutionary patterns."
