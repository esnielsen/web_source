# Biography

I am a PhD candidate within the [von der Heyden lab](https://www.vonderheydenlab.com/) at Stellenbosch University. Some of my research interests include seascape genomics, conservation planning, social-ecological interactions, and ecological niche modeling. 

When I am not working on my PhD, I am most likely on the water, teaching [hula hooping classes] (https://www.facebook.com/ericanielsenflowarts/), or hanging out with my three cats.
